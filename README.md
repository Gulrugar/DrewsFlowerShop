# Drew's Flower Shop


Drew's Flower Shop is fully featured Shopify store that has all custom templates (except password and gift_card). My intention in creating this store was to fully demonstrate my ability to create a Shopify theme and showcase my understanding of web development.

This website is based off the website: [fromyouflowers.com](https://www.fromyouflowers.com/ "From You Flowers") and [Shopify's Theme Dawn](https://github.com/Shopify/dawn "Dawn")


## Store Preview

### Home page

The home page features a slideshow and featured collections as well as a featured blog post section. The home page is also fully responsive just like the entire website is.

In the header you'll notice a **predictive search bar**. The Javascript for the predictive search is based off of the predictive search implemented in dawn and appearance of the content is my own design inspired by the fromyouflower.com website
